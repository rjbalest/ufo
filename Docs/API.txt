I. URL Mapping
--------------
The most general form of the URL mapping is as follows:

http://greenplum.com/main.php?page=<page>&obj=<obj>&method=<method>&ufo[oid]=<oid>&ufo[arg]=<arg>

Where 'main.php' is the single 'driver' page that dispatches to the correct object, depending on the query string.

Depending on the intent, some of the query parameters will be absent or optional.

If 'page' is present, the returned value is an html page.
If 'page' is not present, the returned value is js data.

The remaining arguments map to an object model like this.  Given a class:

class machine {

      get memUsage(int time0, int time1);

};

One could call the memUsage method with a query string like this:

?obj=machine&method=memUsage&ufo[oid]=2372&ufo[time1]=10223334&ufo[time2]=1022396

Therefore we see that:

obj : represents a class name.

method : represents a method.

ufo[] : is an array that represents the method arguments.

ufo[oid] : is the object id, and is the implicit first argument to all instance methods, in other words 'this' or 'self'.

If ufo[oid] is not present, this is equivalent to a 'static' or singleton object method.

When the 'page' argument is missing, the return value from such a method invocation is some javascript data structure.

If, in addition to the previous query string, the 'page' argument is also present, the meaning of this combination is to invoke the method call, and then return the named html page.
