The UFO paradigm is not page oriented, but rather object oriented in a sense.
In fact, the concept of a page is almost entirely absent.  Pages are not crafted one at a time.  Instead, a page is the context in which an object is displayed.  This context is constructed from a discrete set of elements.  Namely, a Prolog, Banner, Blocks ( navigation element ), Body, and Footer.  Obviously, other layouts can be created, but the point is that every 'page' of a website will adhere to a standard design.  Also, each of these elements, or 'tiles', are dynamic and can therefore have changes in appearance from page to page.  However, the constraints on a page are quite strict compared with the possibility of an arbitrary design of each page individually, possible in a page-oriented approach.

Associated with an object are 'views' of that object.  These views are functions which return html code to display the object in various ways.  The default generated code simply displays an object's attributes in a table.  Div elements surrounding the html can be used to style the object with css.
