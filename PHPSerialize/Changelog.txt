v0.4 - 2006-01-08

	Todd DeLuca pointed out that keys are serialized differently than
	values by PHP, and that strings that look like integers are serialized
	as integers.
	
	Ken Restivo pointed out that it'd be nice to be able to decode the
	output from PHP's session_encode.  With helpful code and suggestions
	from Ken, i've implemented session_encode and session_decode.
